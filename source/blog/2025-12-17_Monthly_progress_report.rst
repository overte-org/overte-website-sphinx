Monthly progress report
-----------------------

This month, I decided to change it up a bit and report on the progress to date, instead of only to the end of last month.

Overte e.V. general assembly 2025
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We held our annual assembly on the 6th of December.
The highlights include:

* 2024 and 2025 both our income and our expenses were way higher than expected.

* Our financial prospect for 2026 is good. We should be okay, even if we were to not complete any grant work. (Though donations are always appreciated, since my this assumes my work contract running out at the end of July 2026.)

* Our accounting auditor found no issues. As in previous years, they extended their audit into governance and administration and found no issues or new recommendations.

* We got a new honorary member within our ranks.

* The board can now arbitrarily set the membership fee of non-natural persons (e.g. companies).

A detailed protocol was sent to all Overte e.V. members via email today.

Progress
^^^^^^^^

74hc595 spent way too much time working on way too much stuff again 😉. Taking a break from Qt6, they have resumed work on getting Vulkan merged. (I literally got almost 70 email notification just from the Vulkan Pull Request.)
They diagnosed and fixed performance issues which were stalling our upgrade to libnode 22.
Of course, they also did their usual spree of general contributions like reviewing and testing Pull Requests, in addition to some smaller PRs.

Ada continued work on their UI overhaul, while also continuing to improve OpenXR support, adding better OSC support, and working on adding local lights to the forward renderer. As always, Ada also did a huge amount of other miscellaneous stuff.

HifiExperiments has been helping with all the graphics related changes and fixed OpenGL ES support.

RTUnreal spent a lot of time bumping their head against more or less random build system issues again.

I (Julian Groß) spent my time with small things as they popped up, including working on the next stable release.

We got a new contributor this month: Zedwick has been helping out with updating the documentation and fixing issues with both the chat and the Nametags app.

Part of the team went on holiday in Warszawa during the first week of December.
