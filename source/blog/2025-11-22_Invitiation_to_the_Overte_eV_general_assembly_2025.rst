Invitation to the Overte e.V. general assembly 2025
---------------------------------------------------

Saturday, December 6th at 19:00 UTC we will hold our annual general assembly for the Overte e.V. in Overte. While only active Overte e.V. members are allowed to vote, non-Overte-e.V.-members are also welcome to attend.

The planned agenda is as follows:

- Decide on assembly leader.
- Decide on assembly secretary. The secretary will fill out the protocol during the assembly.
- Accounting report for 2024 and 2025.
- Budgeting for 2026.
- Accounting auditor report (Steve Pruneau).
- Do we have someone that would like to become the accounting auditor? The accounting auditor cannot be a board member.
- Board report.
- Board member elections.
- Vote on allowing the board to set membership fees for non-individuals at their discretion. **[1]**
- Vote on hiring Julian Groß as done through board decision on 8th of July 2025. **[2]**
- Vote on by-law change to specifically mention “approval voting” as the used board election system **[3]**
- Protocol gets signed by the assembly secretary and assembly leader.


**[1]**: Currently, non-individuals (e.g. companies, universities) pay the same 60€ yearly membership fee as everyone else. Some bodies may be willing to pay more but cannot donate due to legal reasons.


**[2]**: The board already hired Julian Groß in accordance with § 6 The Board (3) Duties ( https://satzung.overte.org/en/#aufgaben ). The assembly should still vote on it to back the board in its decision (or fire me).


| **[3]**    Suggested change to § 6 The Board (4) Election:
| From:
| (…) Die Vorstandsmitglieder werden von der Mitgliederversammlung pro zu besetzendem Sitz im gesonderten Wahlgang bestimmt. In jedem Wahlgang geben die Mitglieder eine Stimme pro Kandidaten ab. (…)
| (…) The board members are elected by the general assembly for each to be occupied seat in separate votes. During each vote, each member has one vote per candidate. (…)

| To:
| (…) Die Vorstandsmitglieder werden von der Mitgliederversammlung pro zu besetzendem Sitz im gesonderten Wahlgang bestimmt. Das genutzte Wahlverfahren wird auch als Zustimmungswahl bezeichnet: In jedem Wahlgang geben die Mitglieder eine Stimme pro Kandidaten ab. (…)
| (…) The board members are elected by the general assembly for each to be occupied seat in separate votes. The used voting system is also referred to as "approval voting": During each vote, each member has one vote per candidate. (…)
