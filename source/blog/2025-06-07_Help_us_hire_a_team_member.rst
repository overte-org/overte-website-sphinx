Help us hire a team member!
---------------------------

We are in the process of hiring our long-term contributor Julian Groß, allowing him to dedicate more time to Overte and get things done.

The current proposal is a one-year-long contract for 13 hours per week at German minimum wage. While not much, this is enough for Julian to survive and make work on Overte his main profession.

However, while the Overte e.V. can technically afford that, we are cutting it close. That is why we are asking for your support!

We need to keep some financial cushioning in case of unforeseen costs, so we are doing our first fundraiser to reach our goal of 3000€ of additional funds over the next couple of months.
