"In the Overte community, participants from all over the world come "

"This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of "

"humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with "

"On the 12th of September, we started receiving multiple payments of "
"around 250€ each on our bank account, which were seemed not intended for "
"us. I (Julian Groß) didn't notice these payments initially, as I had "
"already done the monthly accounting and didn't check our bank account. On"
" the 15th of September, we started receiving payments on Stripe, which is"
" our credit card payment provider, as well. Since I got an email "
"notification about those, I knew of them pretty much immediately. Nothing"
" seemed weird there at first; The transactions were using our donation "
"form, so they were clearly labelled as donations. What was odd was that "
"we would suddenly get such large amount of donations in the first place. "
"And, looking closer at them, multiple people were supposedly sharing "
"email addresses. At this point, I started reading through Stripe's "
"documentation and contacted Stripe. Unfortunately, they were very "
"unhelpful. Their documentation suggested this being a card testing scam, "
"and that we should immediately refund everything. Their support was "
"extremely slow, AI translated, and never had anything helpful to say. "
"This is where the first mistake happens as well: I follow Stripe's advice"
" and press the refund button on all the transactions. What I didn't "
"notice at the time, was that Stripe keeps their fees. Meaning that on "
"every refund I make, the Overte e.V. pays a hefty credit card fee. "
"Multiple Euros per transaction. In total, we lost 163,50 € in Stripe "
"fees. Once I noticed this the next day, I started returning only what was"
" left after Stripe's fee. While that saved us from another losing another"
" >100 € in Stripe fees, it ended up incurring a chargeback from one "
"person who really wanted their 1,86 € back. As it turns out, Stripe (and "
"credit card companies) charge 20 € per chargeback. Not to mention the "
"bank responsible for the chargeback graciously rounded up the sum to 1,95"
" €. Contesting chargebacks incurs another 20 € fee. So I decided to just "
"pay up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/index.rst:146
msgid ""
"In the meantime, I noticed transactions also going straight to our bank "
"account. This felt way less problematic, since the fees are *way* lower "
"than for credit card stuff, and we have rule of law there, rather than "
"credit card companies and payment providers just offloading everything "
"onto us. At this point, I got in contact with the Police, since the "
"victims suddenly had names and identities, and as opposed to our Stripe "
"account, I wasn't willing to just close it off. The local Policeman knew "
"immediately what was going on and asked me to inform the victims by "
"sending them messages via SEPA bank transfers. Turns out, instant bank "
"transfers are faster than the police. At least as long as the victims "
"check their bank accounts regularly."
