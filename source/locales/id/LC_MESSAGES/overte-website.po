"In the Overte community, participants from all over the world come "
"together to create a Free and Open Source social-VR platform. This is "
"made possible by the support, hard work, and enthusiasm of many people "

"This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of "
"community we want to have. The rules below are not applied to all "

"in context and are complex. Perceived violations are evaluated by real "
"humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with "
"kindness. Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules"
